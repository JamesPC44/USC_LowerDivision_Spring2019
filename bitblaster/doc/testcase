# Format for the Testcases:

## Parameters:

Inputs will be in the following ranges:

N: (1, infinity)

A: (1, infinity)

For all A: A1 ^ A2 ^ ... ^ AN != 0. (If a case is generated, pick a number to change by 1 or something)

## Input:

N -> Number of stacks

A1, A2, A3, ... AN -> Numerical Values of the stacks

## Output:

AX BX -> AX: Initial value of the stack that was changed, BX: New Stack Value

Note: Since in the game of nim, there can be multiple stacks with the same value, this solves that problem of the program finding the correct value, but in a dfferent stack than the one that My Implementation does.
